	<h2>About Me</h2>
	
	<p>
I am a postdoctoral research fellow at Harvard Medical School in the T32 Sleep Medicine program, working in the Sleep, Cognition, and Neuropsychiatry Lab under Dr. Dara Manoach. My current research focuses on identifying neural biomarkers of sleep-related learning and memory in clinical populations including schizophrenia and autism, using neuroimaging, EEG, and machine learning methods.
</p>

<p>
My interest in translational science developed during my time as a Translational Neuroscience Intern at Sage Therapeutics, where I used deep learning and EEG analysis to identify sleep-related biomarkers for response to Zuranolone, a GABAA positive allosteric modulator, in individuals with major depressive disorder and insomnia. This experience deepened my commitment to precision psychiatry to develop computational tools to better understand individual differences in brain function.

<p>
I completed my Ph.D. in Psychology and Neuroscience at Boston College, where I worked with Dr. Stefano Anzellotti in the Social and Cognitive Computational Neuroscience Lab. My doctoral work examined how the brain computes visual features related to face perception—such as identity and expression. This required the integration of neural and behavioral data with computer vision and representational modeling. Though I’ve shifted focus from social perception to clinical neuroscience, this work laid the foundation for my interest in how complex perceptual and cognitive processes are represented in the brain.

<p>
Before graduate school, I studied Psychology and Child and Adolescent Mental Health at NYU, where I became fascinated by the way modeling can be used to answer questions about the human brain and behavior. This interest continues to drive my research today.
