	<h2>About Me</h2>
	<p> 
		How does our brain recognize faces? And how does our brain disentangle the perceptual features involved in different face tasks (e.g. identity and facial expression recognition)? 
		For example, when recognizing an individualâ€™s facial expression, do our brains use face identity information to correctly identify what is and is not important to recognize a facial expression? 
		My research aims to answer these questions by leveraging neural and behavioral data, computer vision, and statistical analysis to quantitatively measure the different face features within visual 
		representations and how these different pieces of information are transformed along the processing stream of the brain and deep convolutional neural networks.

		I am a 4th year Ph.D. student in Psychology and Neuroscience at Boston College. I work with Dr. Stefano Anzellotti in the Social and Cognitive Computational Neuroscience Lab. Prior to graduate school, 
		I studied Psychology and Child and Adolescent Mental Health. Here, I became fascinated with how we can use mathematical modeling to answer questions about the human brain and individual differences. 
		This spurred an interest in face prosopagnosia and understanding how our brain computes properties related to social perception. As neuroimaging and computational methods have improved over time, 
		many of the previous theories on social perceptual mechanisms have been challenged, leading to questions on how our brain effectively processes and uses perceptual information.
